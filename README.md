# Predicting Property Prices Using Linear Regression Analysis -
The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust predictive model for estimating property prices accurately, focusing exclusively on Linear Regression analysis.

The project began by curating a comprehensive dataset containing a wide range of property-related attributes. These attributes encompass variables such as property size, location, number of bedrooms, amenities, and historical pricing data. The dataset underwent thorough preprocessing, which included handling missing data, identifying and addressing outliers, and encoding categorical variables into numerical features.

Using this meticulously prepared dataset, we applied Linear Regression analysis to predict property prices. We evaluated the model's performance using key regression metrics, including Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared. The project's success is dependent on the accuracy and reliability of the Linear Regression model in estimating property prices.

The Linear Regression model not only provides precise property price estimates but also offers valuable insights into the factors that influence property values. This information is invaluable for real estate stakeholders and investors, enabling them to make well-informed decisions in a dynamic and competitive real estate market.

In summary, this project underscores the effectiveness of Linear Regression analysis in understanding the determinants of property prices and providing a dependable tool for estimating property values. It empowers stakeholders in the real estate industry to navigate the market with greater confidence and make data-driven investment choices.
